# Quantitative-Analysis-of-England-covid-mortality
Statistical analysis of socio-economic factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rates across English local authorities. Includes data processing, exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and an interactive R Shiny dashboard. Developed for MSc Data Science quantitative research project.

# Objectives
Analyze Regional Disparities: Quantify how factors like education, health status, and mobility patterns correlate with mortality.

Develop Predictive Models: Build and compare multiple regression models (35.8% variance explained) to identify significant predictors.

Create Policy Insights: Highlight vulnerable populations through data-driven findings (e.g., low education â†’ 47% higher mortality correlation).

Deploy Interactive Tools: Build an R Shiny dashboard for dynamic data exploration and hypothesis testing.
